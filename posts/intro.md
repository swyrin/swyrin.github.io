Well, took me a while to cook this in Next.js, but it is here, by the way. This is the extension version of my resume,
if you please.

Do some proper introduction, shall we?

My name is Tien Dat Pham, or "Ph·∫°m Ti·∫øn ƒê·∫°t" in Vietnamese. And I am currently a hobbyist
Back-End Developer (*or B.E.D. hobbyist, ba-dum-tss*) and a suck-at-everywhere gamer. Outside
of that, I also did...

# Starlight üéâ

Yeah, another 4-Button VSRG right?

This is the first time I have to do this much of a task:
- Doing Quality Assurance.
- Maintaining the server.
- Making a game in [Phaser](https://phaser.io).
- Fixing bugs, I mean *lots* of bugs, in the web interface.
- Writing documentation for literally **everything**.
- Doing CI/CD because I can't believe much in my team.
- And much more...

And all of that is just for a simple assignment.

Furthermore, we have to take care of *someone's* bachelor thesis. *Wish he knew how to code.*

Nonetheless, the project is located here: [https://github.com/team-nameless/starlight](https://github.com/team-nameless/starlight).

# nameless* üéâ

The Discord BOT intended for my own Discord server, but made open source.

Think like it is the Swiss Knife‚Ñ¢Ô∏è in terms of feature set. And our playground for Python experimental tools like [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) or [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

The source code is right here: [https://github.com/team-nameless/nameless-discord-bot](https://github.com/team-nameless/nameless-discord-bot)

# MSOC - maimai Student Open Cup

The first non-code event that I *somehow* proud of it, as the founder, coordinator and gold‚Ñ¢Ô∏è sponsor.

You can view the LinkedIn post for the tournament [here, from the tournament organizer himself](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/xu%C3%A2n-th%C3%A1i-phan-bab693352_msoc-2024-my-first-step-in-esports-event-activity-7300042302784233472-0Zwe/?rcm=ACoAADnsUxQBRmXoK-nS4-ZFnp_kKUxBHQeNyd8).

## Final words

I think this is the end of the flex showcase. If I have anything notable, it will be added to this Hall of Fame ASAP :D

Bye for now üëã
